# Hello-World-
Hi guys,just a normal boy from Vietnam who got himself up here to learn how to code and stuffs.

cout << "So I found a 4hrs long video on Youtube teaching me C++,it was so much more entertaining and easier to understand than what my teachers are doing at school" << endl;

cout << "Well they basically showing us how to do this,how to do that.I mean the HOW part,like how to get good grades and make your parents proud while you learn absolute nothing in school but your grades are high af so it's okay.\n";

cout << "But we need the WHY part as well,since when we understand something,we do it way easier.For example,in my class they pronounce cout as count for some reasons,maybe they are bad at English but the main point is,they don't know what it means.It stands for console-out,which should be pronouced c-out.And our teachers didn't teach that,they said just type cout and the plain texts aka string behind it and the << symbol will appear on the damn screen" << endl;

cout << "I don't blame them since they are Asian and we,I think the whole world were taught this way.No one will tell you that going to school will make you less intelligence.They are many type of intelligence and school teaches us the Academy Intelligence.But if we somehow find our own way,we can accomplish many different things.\n";

cout << "People that I have met in school or on social medias,they always blame their fates,blame that their parents are not so rich as the others,claim that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet were so succedded in their lives are because of they had what it takes,this part was right,nothing to talk about,but they also say that because of their parents were rich or had a huge impact.That they will do the same if they have parents as rich as they were.Since when people turn stuff on the internet to things that cover their fear,cover their stupidity.These guys will never reach success in their lives until they get rid of these thoughts.They have been taught this way I guess,or they were born cowards.But this needs to be changed.\n";
